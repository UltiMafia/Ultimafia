      "Recruit: An action which changes a player's faction without changing their role. A non-meeting Mafia-aligned player who gets recruited at the beginning of the game to the Liaison's faction can no longer win with the Mafia and instead wins with all other Liaison faction members. Some role conversions automatically recruit a player to another faction: a Defector may convert to Mafia, which automatically recruits them to the Mafia faction because that is the assigned faction of the Mafia role.",
